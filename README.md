Kong Plugin - AI-Powered Response Transformer
====================

The AI-Powered Response Transformer is a Kong plugin designed to enhance your API responses by seamlessly integrating with the OpenAI chat completion API. This plugin enables you to transform the response generated by your upstream server in real-time before delivering it to the client.

### Key Features
- **JSON Field Manipulation:** You can add or replace JSON fields within the response by providing a customizable prompt.
- **Parameterization:** The plugin supports parameterization, allowing you to include one of the JSON fields from the response body in your prompt. This enables advanced customization based on the content of the response itself.

**Note:** This plugin is an updated version of the [Response Transformer by Kong Inc.](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/response-transformer/), enhancing its capabilities with AI-powered transformations.

Whether you need to enrich your API responses with contextual information, generate dynamic content, or make on-the-fly adjustments, the AI-Powered Response Transformer plugin helps you to create customizable and intelligent responses for your API clients.

## Configuration

This plugin inherits the configuration parameters from the [Kong Response Transformer by Kong Inc](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/response-transformer/configuration/). Additionally, it introduces three new configuration parameters:

- `config.add_with_ai`: This parameter allows you to specify how you want to add new fields to the response body using AI support. It consists of the following sub-parameters:

  - `json`: An array of key-value pairs that you want to add to the JSON response body. You can use parameters in `${FIELD_NAME}` format in the prompt to include one of the JSON fields from the response body. Ex.: `"json": [ "error_detail:Generate human readable message for this error: ${error}" ]`

  - `max_tokens`: You can set this parameter to restrict the maximum number of tokens per OpenAI API request when adding new fields. This helps in managing the size and complexity of AI-generated content. _(Default: 50)_

- `config.replace_with_ai`: This parameter enables you to define how existing fields in the response body should be replaced using AI support. It includes the following sub-parameters:

  - `json`: An array of key-value pairs that you want to replace in the JSON response body. You can use parameters in `${FIELD_NAME}` format in the prompt to include one of the JSON fields from the response body. Ex.: `"json": [ "error:Generate human readable message for this error: ${error}" ]`

  - `max_tokens`: Similar to the `config.add_with_ai` parameter, you can set `max_tokens` here to limit the number of tokens used in AI-generated replacements. _(Default: 50)_

- `config.openai_api_key`: This parameter allows you to set the OpenAI API Key, which is essential for making requests to the OpenAI chat completion API.

## Examples

The following examples provide configurations for enabling the ai-powered-response-transformer plugin on a service:

```
plugins:
- name: ai-powered-response-transformer
  service: SERVICE_NAME|ID
  config:
    add_with_ai:
      json:
      - greeting:'Generate a greeting message for ${username}.'
      - weather:'Generate a weather description for the temperature ${temp} and humidity ${humid}'
      max_tokens: 50
    replace_with_ai:
      json:
      - error:'Generate human readable message for this error: ${error}'
      max_tokens: 20
    openai_api_key: 0296217561490155228da9c17fc555cf9db82d159732f3206638c25f04a285c4
